# Dodo
###### A small Todo list for Dodo brains like me

This app will focus on building a todo list app and have a main focus around learning Local Data Persistance

In this app we will make use of the following:
```
UserDefaults - For small bits of data
Codable - To tap into the Documents folder on the device
CoreData - An SQL like database which allows for the creation of relational databases
Realm - A framework similar to CoreData
```

Happy Coding!
